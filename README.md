# React chatapp

To run the code you need Rethinkdb and the websocket server written in Go which can be found here: [chatappserver](https://github.com/Inveracity/chatappserver.git)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Inveracity/chatappfrontend.git

cd chatappfrontend

npm install

web-dev-server

```
